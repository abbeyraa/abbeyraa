# Hi, I'm Abby 👋

I focus on building **practical automation and analysis systems** — tools designed to reduce manual work, surface insights, and behave predictably in real-world conditions.

I deliberately keep my scope narrow. Every project here exists because a real workflow was inefficient or unreliable.

## 🚀 Current Projects

### AI Sentiment & Insight Engine
A structured analysis pipeline that processes text-based data to detect sentiment, patterns, and behavioral signals, then converts them into **clear, actionable insights**.

This project prioritizes:
- Interpretability over black-box models  
- Traceable data flow and repeatable analysis  
- Outputs that support decisions, not just metrics  

The system is designed to evolve incrementally as data quality and analytical needs mature.

### Form Web Automation System
A web automation tool built to reliably handle repetitive form-based workflows that are often error-prone and time-consuming when done manually.

The focus is on:
- Deterministic automation (explicit selectors, controlled flows)  
- Data-driven execution (CSV/XLSX as input)  
- Practical reliability over brittle, one-off scripts  

This project emphasizes robustness against real-world web constraints such as validation quirks, pop-ups, and inconsistent page states.

## 🧠 Working Principles

My work is guided by a few non-negotiables:
- Systems must be observable and debuggable  
- Automation should reduce cognitive load, not increase it  
- Simplicity beats abstraction until complexity is unavoidable  

I prefer fewer systems that work well over many that do not.

This repository reflects **active development**, not polished products.  
Design decisions are intentional, and trade-offs are documented as the systems evolve.
